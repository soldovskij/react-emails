# Generating Emails with React
This is an example project you can use to generate emails with React. You can start by reading the article [here](https://building.lang.ai/how-to-build-emails-with-react-fcf941b125d1).

>  If you want to generate PDFs using react, check the [react-pdfs](https://github.com/lang-ai/react-pdfs) repo.


### Example

To provide an example as starting point, this project generates a weather
forecast by using the [MetaWeather API][metaweather].

To generate the example email:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
$ node example/weather.js
```

The result html will be saved in the working directory. Here is what it looks
like:

### Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App][react-create-app].
 See the development guide [here][react-create-app-guide].


### Creating the email

To create the email, simply import the module and call the function with the
data. It returns a promise that resolves to the full HTML template as a string.

```js
const createEmail = require('react-emails-example');

const data = { 
  name: 'Alberto',
  title: 'Demo email',
};

createEmail(data)
  .then((html) => {
    // Send the HTML with your email service of choice
  });
```
